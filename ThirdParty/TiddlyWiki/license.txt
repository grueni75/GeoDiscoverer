Copyrights:

    This work is based upon TiddlyWiki 2.5.0, created by Jeremy Ruston, Â© 2004-2009 UnaMesa Association. Modifications and additions to this work, including (but not limited to) original programmatic components ("plugins", "macros", "scripts", "stylesheets") have been created by Eric L. Shulman and/or ELS Design Studios.

    These components are distributed using an open source model; however, they are not in the public domain, and the author retains all applicable rights. You are permitted to use, copy, and/or modify individual components of this work, subject to the licensing terms and conditions specifically included within or referenced by those individual components, as well as other terms, conditions, instructions, and guidelines included herein, as well as all terms and conditions defined by the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License.

Terms of use:

    This work contains individual components that are intended to be selectively copied and installed into your own TiddlyWiki files in order to enhance and customize those documents. You may download and save this work for use only as a local resource to assist you in developing your own TiddlyWiki document designs. However, you may not re-distribute this document in it's entirety, nor re-use it's overall design without prior written permission.

    Tiddlers can be imported from any TiddlyWiki document. As a consequence, if you share your document with even just ONE other person, you become a "re-distributor" of the tiddlers contained in that document. As such, you should avoid modifying any TiddlyTools components you have installed in your own documents unless there is a compelling, functional reason to do so and, even then, the best approach is often to simply submit a feature request to the original author/publisher and leave it up to them to determine the best way to modify and re-publish those components.

    Nonetheless, if you do modify and/or share components of this work, you should always retain the original published content within those components, including all documentation, credits, licensing information, and URL references to the official distribution source for the unaltered versions of those components. In addition, all modified components must be clearly identifiable as derivative works that have been differentiated from the original versions by renaming those components, as well as adding inline comments and a "revision history" to document specific changes.

    If you share a modified TiddlyTools component, you must be prepared to support it. All problems that occur within a modified component should be reported first directly to the provider of that modified component, and then only reported to TiddlyTools if it can be shown that the problem also occurs in TiddlyTools' officially-published version of the component. Any problems that are reported for undifferentiated modifications won't receive help from TiddlyTools (once they are determined to be modified, of course!), other than to direct the inquiry to wherever they got the modified components from in the first place.

    Except for officially-published links to specific components of this work, you must not create or share deep links to online components of this work (e.g., images, audio, video, etc.). Instead, you should copy the desired components (subject to applicable licenses and copyrights) to your own system or online hosting service, and ensure that your document contains references to those copies.
